<h1>"Fried" Ice Cream</h1>
<p>Frying ice cream just sounds stressful to us. So we opted to skip it. Instead, we coat ice cream in buttery, crunchy corn flakes that gets toasted separately so they taste fried without the drama. Try it with Death by Chocolate Ice Cream next!<br>If you DO want to try frying ice cream here's how to do it: 
Scoop ice cream onto a baking sheet and freeze for 1 hour. Place 3 large egg whites in a bowl and beat with a fork until frothy. Place corn flakes, cinnamon, and sugar in another bowl. 
Roll ice cream in egg whites and then in corn flakes, pressing to coat. Place back on baking sheet and freeze for 4 hours or until completely solid. 
Heat a large pot of canola oil to 375Â°. Working one at a time, fry ice cream for 20 seconds. Top and serve immediately! </p>
